ITAI-1371 – Classic Machine Learning

Houston Community College (HCC) | Spring 2026

This repository contains my lab assignments and projects for ITAI-1371: Classic Machine Learning at Houston Community College during the Spring 2026 semester.

The course focuses on foundational machine learning concepts, practical development tools, and collaborative workflows used in real-world AI and data science environments.

📚 Course Objectives

Throughout this course, I will:

Develop proficiency with GitHub for version control and collaboration

Apply data manipulation techniques using pandas

Perform numerical computations with NumPy

Create visualizations using matplotlib

Implement data preprocessing workflows for machine learning

Practice reproducible ML development using structured notebooks

Strengthen technical reflection and analytical thinking

🧪 Lab Structure

Each lab in this repository includes:

A completed lab notebook (exported as PDF)

All required outputs and visualizations

A reflective journal analyzing learning insights and challenges

Proper version control using branches and pull requests (when required)

🔹 Lab 01 – Getting Started with GitHub

This lab introduced foundational GitHub skills essential for machine learning collaboration.

Skills Practiced:

Creating and managing repositories

Cloning repositories locally

Creating branches

Making commits

Pushing changes

Opening and merging Pull Requests

Collaborating with team members

Deliverable included a shared file (hello_ml.txt) demonstrating successful collaboration through version control.

This lab established the workflow that will be used throughout the semester for submitting and managing ML projects.
