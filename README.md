## 🧪 Lab Structure

Each lab in this repository includes:

- Completed lab notebook (exported as PDF when required)
- All executed code with visible outputs
- Data visualizations and analysis
- A reflective journal analyzing learning insights and technical challenges
- Proper version control practices (branching, commits, pull requests when applicable)

All work is completed independently unless otherwise specified by the assignment.
